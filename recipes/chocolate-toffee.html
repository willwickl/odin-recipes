        <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>1 pound of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 stick of butter (4 tbs) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>

    <h3>Instructions: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a double boiler over gently simmering water (or in a bowl in a microwave), combine the chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and cool until the mixture is lukewarm.</li>
        <li>In mixer on medium speed, beat the brown sugar and eggs until thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce speed to low. Add the chocolate mixture from step 2 and vanilla extract and mix until well combined</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Stir in toffee walnuts.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350F and line the baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Drop heaping tablespoons of the dough two inches apart on the sheet. Sprinkle each cookie with sea salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake until the tops of cookies are dry and cracked but are still soft to the touch, about 12-14 minutes; do not overbake.</li>
        <li>Let cookies cool for 2 minutes after removing from the oven. Then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
